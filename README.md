# Brightspace MCP Server

> **By [Rohan Muppa](https://github.com/rohanmuppa), ECE @ Purdue**

Talk to your Brightspace courses with AI. Ask about grades, due dates, announcements, and more. Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and Windsurf.

This is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects your AI to D2L Brightspace so it can pull your grades, assignments, syllabus, and course content on demand.

Works with any school that uses D2L Brightspace, including Purdue, USC, TU Delft, and hundreds more.

## Try It

> "Download my lecture slides and turn them into interactive flashcards"
> "Grab every assignment rubric and build me a visual dashboard of what I need to hit for an A"

## Install

**You need:** [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (download the LTS version)

**Option 1: Let your AI do it**

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Codex, or any AI coding assistant:

```
Install brightspace-mcp-server for me by following
https://github.com/RohanMuppa/brightspace-mcp-server/blob/main/LLMs.md
(use --purdue if I'm at Purdue).
```

**Option 2: Run it yourself**

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server setup
```

Purdue students can add `--purdue` to skip entering the school URL:

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server setup --purdue
```

TU Delft students can use `--tudelft` (login via login.tudelft.nl is fully automated — no MFA prompt):

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server setup --tudelft
```

The wizard walks you through login, MFA, and auto configures Claude Desktop and Cursor. Restart your AI client when it finishes.

<summary>Using a different client? Configure it manually.</summary>

Search your client's docs for how to add an MCP server. The server command to register is:

```
npx -y brightspace-mcp-server@latest
```

On **Windows**, npx must be wrapped: `cmd /c npx -y brightspace-mcp-server@latest`

You still need to run `npx brightspace-mcp-server setup` first to save your credentials.

## Session Expired?

Sessions re-authenticate automatically. If auto-reauth fails (e.g., you missed the Duo push):

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server auth
```

## What You Can Ask About

| Topic | Examples |
|-------|---------|
| Grades | "Am I passing all my classes?" · "Compare my grades across all courses" |
| Assignments | "What's due in the next 48 hours?" · "Summarize every assignment I haven't turned in yet" |
| Announcements | "Did any professor post something important today?" · "What did my CS prof announce this week?" |
| Course content | "Find the midterm review slides" · "Download every PDF from Module 5" |
| Roster | "Who are the TAs for ECE 264?" · "Get me my instructor's email" |
| Discussions | "What are people saying in the final project thread?" · "Summarize the latest discussion posts" |
| Planning | "Build me a study schedule based on my upcoming due dates" · "Which class needs the most attention right now?" |

## Security

- Credentials stay on your machine at `~/.brightspace-mcp/config.json` (restricted permissions)
- Session tokens are encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
- All traffic to Brightspace is HTTPS
- Nothing is sent anywhere except your school's login page

## Contributing & Forking

Want to add your school, build a new tool, or fix something? Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request. If it gets merged, it ships to every user automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RohanMuppa/brightspace-mcp-server.git
cd brightspace-mcp-server
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Add your school:** Add a preset to `SCHOOL_PRESETS` in `src/setup.ts`. If your school's login flow is different, add a handler in `src/auth/`.

**Add a new tool:** Create a file in `src/tools/`, add the schema in `schemas.ts`, export it in `src/tools/index.ts`, and register it in `src/index.ts`. Use any existing tool as a template.

**Run your own version:** You can also fork and run it independently. Clone it, build it, and point your AI client to the local `build/index.js` instead of using `npx`. No npm needed. Just know that forks don't receive updates from this repo automatically. If your changes could help others, consider opening a PR.

## Updates

Automatic. Every time your AI client starts a session, it runs `npx brightspace-mcp-server@latest` which pulls the newest version from npm. No action needed.

If you ever suspect you're on an old version, run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the cache.
